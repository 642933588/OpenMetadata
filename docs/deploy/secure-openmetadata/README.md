# Secure OpenMetadata

OpenMetadata has support for Google SSO and Okta SSO as identity providers. Please see the next sections about how to configure them.

Enabling Security is only required for your production installation. If you are testing OpenMetadata it will be easier and faster to set up without security. To get up and running quickly with OpenMetadata (without security), please follow the [Run OpenMetadata](https://docs.open-metadata.org/v/0.10.0-preview/overview/run-openmetadata) guide.
